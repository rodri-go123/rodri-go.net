		<h3>Hybrid Publication, 2021</h3>
		<a class="website_link" href="https://rodri-go.net/theautonomousweb/">Read/Visit</a><br>
		<p>How can people self-govern their internet experience? How can they obtain autonomy from the internet while still being able to use it according to their needs?<br>
			<br>
			These are the questions at the core of <a class="website_link" href="https://rodri-go.net/theautonomousweb/">The Autonomous Web</a>, which takes the form of a hybrid publication. In its search for internet autonomy, this publication reimagines the web as two extreme versions of itself. An oppressive, alienating dystopia where users became enslaved by the web, and its polar opposite, a utopian realm where biological life and the autonomous internet exist in true cybernetic harmony.

		<h3>Machine-Learning Synthesiser, 2021</h3>
		<a class="website_link" href="http://rodri-go.net/digital-craft-research-paper/conversing-with-ais.html">Read further.</a><br>
		<p>HOPE is a machine learning synthesiser that plays back when spoken or played to. Its main goal is to create conversations between a human artist and an artificial one,
			using sound. Inspired by a common exercise in jazz improvisation, where two instruments ‘talk’ to each other, this synthesiser works in real time and can play piano,
			drums and all kinds of funky waveforms. It can also take its own output as new input, iterating on itself and creating an endless feedback loop of new sounds,
			challenging ideas of creativity and artistic production.<br>
			<br>
			HOPE stands for Heuristic Oscillation Prediction Engine, because all anthropomorphised pieces of software need a cool acronym.</p>

      <p>In times when the real world shuts down,
        the Cloud grows bigger – both in size and
        importance – and the urgency to adapt is real.
        WORMworld is the virtual embodiment of the
        Open City. Much like WORM, it serves as a
        portal into the obscure world of alternative
        culture and art. It’s designed in such a way
        that the familiarity and iconography of the
        emblematic WORM building are translated into
        the web page.</p>

					<h3>Multidisciplinary Project, 2019</h3>
					<p>
						The green scribbles right here carry a surprising load of information – they’re the vibrations of different frequencies affecting a laser pointer.<br>
						<em>Cymatics</em> arose from endless experiments with the shapes of sound. In what is just the start of a bigger project, explore inventive new ways to use the physicality of sound in the world of music.<br>

					<strong>Visual Harmony</strong><br>
					The thought that the things we listen to can be made visible – not by an artist’s impression of the song – but by the sound waves themselves, unaffected by the subjectivity of the signs and symbols we currently use to write music, is pretty interesting on its own.<br>
					<br>
					Where it gets fascinating however, is when one observes that there’s a correlation between sonic harmony and visual harmony. A perfectly executed C Major chord for example, will result in a rather harmonious, satisfying, slow-flowing figure. But playing the same notes half a tone too high, which would break the harmony of the chord, results in a messy shape which moves too fast to understand. This makes a system in which these shapes are used to describe sound instead of music notes a nice supplement for music learning, making use of the phenomenon of synesthesia to help musicians who are visual learners to connect harmonic shapes to sounds.<br>
					<br>
					The same writing system also finds its potential in the world of jazz improvisation (a project that I’m looking to develop at the moment, so if you’re an interested improv musician get in touch with me!), where the musician can interpret a song by playing to its cymatic movement instead of an actual music sheet.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Light-mapping, a restricted signifier</strong><br>
					This same principle that we’re using to capture the shapes of chords and frequencies can be extended to the duration of an entire song, album, or speech. By doing this one will obtain a literal light map of an audio piece.
					<br>
					Why this is relevant to music merchandising brings us to the concept of a restricted signifier: the idea of intimate symbology is a growing universe, perhaps most noticeably in the tattoo world. More people are choosing to tattoo words or symbols that convey meaning only to them, over popular symbols that carry a universal meaning. Bringing us back to the music world, where popular brands are selling millions of Nirvana, Ramones and Bowie (among many others) shirts, it’s understandable (and encouraged!) that some fans choose to engage in more intimate and discrete ways to devote their fandom to their favourite artist.<br>
					<br>
					Wearing the light-map of an entire piece of music, a whole album, discography, or just a fragment of a song offers a solution to this situation. The examples above feature The Prodigy, as a tribute to Keith Flint, and David Bowie.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Organic VJing</strong><br>
					So far I’ve proposed ways to expand this system in ways that go beyond the beauty of its shapes. However, ignoring it would be a waste. Mixing the aesthetic of the shapes, the practicality of the setup and the poetic nature of looking at an exact translation of sound, gave birth to Organic VJing.<br>
					<br>
					Setting up an enlarged version of this shapes by adding only a camera and a beamer is a  practical and budget friendly way to create live visuals. However, this doesn’t take away the job of the VJ – it’s up to him or her to come up with ways to customise the setup by splitting channels, overlapping layers, or manipulating size &amp; colours, to fit the performance better.</p></div>
